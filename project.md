# [litpro-jshint](# "version: 0.1.0")

This implements the jshint command.

Run `literate-programming -b . project.md` initially. After that, one can
just run `literate-programming` and the lprc.js file will do what needs to be
done. 

This is designed to work with the 1.0 version of literate-programming.


## Directory structure

* [index.js](#index "save: |jshint") This is the file that runs this. It is a
  thin layer on top of the command line module and putting in various litpro
  plugins. 
* [README.md](#readme "save: ") The standard README.
* [lprc.js](#lprc "save:| jshint") This contains the options of how to compile
  this using the new version. Not currently used. 
* [package.json](#npm-package "save: | jshint") The requisite package file for a npm project. 
* [TODO.md](#todo "save: | raw ## Todo, ---") A list of growing and shrinking items todo.
* [LICENSE](#license-mit "save: | raw ## License, ---") The MIT license as I think that is the standard in the node community. 
* [.npmignore](#npmignore "save: ")
* [.gitignore](#gitignore "save: ")
* [.travis.yml](#travis "save: ")


## Index

This is the primary file that will be read. It should export a function that
takes in the Folder and args. Typically, one would add commands and directives
to Folder, after requiring any other modules. 


    module.exports = function(Folder, args) {

        // following examples as templates

    };


### Sync Commands

These are the simplest. The return value is used to continue the flow. They
have access to incoming text and the comma separated arguments.

        Folder.sync("cmd", function (input, args, name) {
            var doc = this;
            
            //do stuff with input (in text) and the pipe arguments

            return value;
        });

### Async Command

Call the callback. It has typical node signature of err, value.

        Folder.async("cmdasync", function (input, args, callback, name) {
            var doc = this;

            //do stuff with input and pipe arguments
            // when async done, call callback with err, value 
        
            // no return value

        });

### Raw Command

Do whatever you like, but to continue on, you need to have the text ready
event for the passed in name.

        Folder.commands.cmdraw = function (input, args, name, command) {
            var doc = this;
            var gcd = doc.gcd;

            // stuff

            gcd.emit("text ready:" + name, value);
        }

### Directives

This allows you to create a directive. There are no shortcuts. The cache
allows one to call expensive arguments (such as reading files) and cache them
across folders. The pipes is an example of how to have the command argument
processing familiar with substitutions. It can be convenient, for example with
save commands. 

        Folder.directives["dir words"] = function (args) {
            var doc = this;
            var gcd = doc.gcd;

            var linktext = args.link;
            var titlepostcolon = args.input;
            var href = args.href;
            var currentheading = args.cur;
            var directive = args.directive;

            //do stuff. returns are ignored.

            //cache example

            doc.parent.Folder.fcd.cache(
                ["starting event", startingData],
                "expected response event",
                function (data) {
                    var fcd = this;

                    //you can emit gcd events via closures

                    return value;
                }, 
                "event emitted with return value to fcd"
            );

            //pipes example
    
            // allowing stuff before first pipe to be some other use
            pipes = title.slice(title.indexOf("|")).trim(); 
            var emitname = "something unique";
   
                if (pipes) {
                    pipes += '"';
                    f = function (data) {
                        //do something with computed data
                        // such as doc.store(linktext, data);
                    };
                    gcd.once("text ready:" + emitname, f);
                    doc.pipeParsing(pipes, 0, '"', emitname, blockForMinors);
                    gcd.emit("text ready:" + emitname + colon.v + "0", prePipeResult );
                } else {
                    //do something with prePipe Result
                    //such as doc.store(linktext, perPipeResult);
                }
            }

## lprc

This creates the lprc file for the plugin. Basically, it just says to run
project.md as the file of choice and to build it in the top directory.


    module.exports = function(Folder, args) {

        if (files.length === 0) {
            args.files = ["project.md"];
        }
        args.build = ".";
        args.src = ".";

    }

## Readme

This is the readme for the plugin.  

    # Stuff

    This is a plugin for [literate-programming](https://github.com/jostylr/literate-programming). Install that and then you can use this by requiring it in the lprc.js file. 


## npm package

This should setup the npm file

## gitignore

Stuff not to include in git. Don't check in your modules.

    node_modules

    

## npmignore

npm does not need to see your tests or your litpro code. Submit the js stuff!
Despite the `*.md`, your readme file will be seen. 

    tests
    test.js
    travis.yml
    ghpages
    node_modules
    *.md
    

## Travis

You write tests, right? 


    language: node_js
    node_js:
      - "0.10"
      - "iojs"
      - "0.12"
