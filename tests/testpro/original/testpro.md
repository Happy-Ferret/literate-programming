# Test Literate Program

We just need a place to do some minor tests.


## Body

The body of the test  [testpro.js](# "save: js|jshint")


[](# "js")

    te = (function () {
        return  _"f1";
    })();

    three = _`1+1+1`;

    function () {
        _"cl"
    }


## f1

A function

    function () {
        great = 3;
        return great;
    }

## cl

    console.log("I was here");
 
  
   



## Now for some bad stuff

What happens if to blocks refer to each other? 

[Alice](# )

    Alice needs _":Bob"

[Bob](# )

    Bob needs _":Alice"

## Now for some bad stuff

What happens if to blocks refer to each other? 

[Alex](# )

    Alex is good.

[Bobby](# "|log" )

    Bobby needs _":Alex"

## What is up 

Can we refer to the second block?

[out](# "|log")

    George thinks _"Now for some bad stuff 1:Alex"
